# Paul's Experimental Pages

I have a secret experimental menu pages, anything that I want to work on in "secret" or just to use the server, I will upload here to either share for business reasons or to try out or whatever

Currently on the experimental pages
- [LearnToCode](http://www.pgonzbecer.com/experiments/LearnToCode): This is here because it's own repository is acting up
- [GraphingGFX](http://www.pgonzbecer.com/experiments/GraphingGFX): This one I am not even sure if I should pursue, but it is here because I want to replace the graphing js with a custom built one for [Open Graphing Calculator](http://www.opengraphingcalculator.com/)
