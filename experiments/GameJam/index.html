					<p class="text-info">
						JavaScript is the code of the web, a guide to tell the browser what you want it to do and how you
						want it done. You can say that coding is an art form, because it is not something so intuitive as
						most other things. But that shouldn't discourage you because in order to understand coding, you
						must understand that it requires a different way of looking and thinking about things. It requires
						a more logical, more rigid way of thinking, computational thinking if you may, than just an assumption
						presumption of human thinking.
					</p>
					<p class="text-info">
						This means that the normal way of thinking through a problem is always a gray line, like the word gray
						itself. You can spell it gray or grey, it is accepted both ways and even pronounced the same. Which is
						fine, but computers don't understand that. Computers can only view the world in a black or white fashion.
						It is either true or false, 0 or 1. For computers they can only accept gray, because that is how it is
						programmed in and that is what they know to be true. This kind of thinking really stumps people when
						they program, understand how to think this way and you are one step closer to learning how to program!
					</p>
					<p class="text-info">
						Next thing you should also understand is that you never stop learning things about coding. Look at examples,
						dissect them, play around with them, experiment with different things here and there. If something doesn't
						work or is getting hard to do, try something else or look at it in a different angle. The more you play around
						with things the more you are learning about them and will slowly develop ideas on how to use them. And don't
						forget if you get stuck and can't get out, ask around! The internet has bundles of helpful forums and communities
						for programming in general. Or ask someone you know that understands coding to help you with the problem or
						help you understand the problem.
					</p>
					<p class="text-info">
						You can honestly start with any computer language when you first learn to code, but the easiest ones are BASIC,
						which is kind of self explanitory, and JavaScript. Which with JavaScript you can actually show to your friends, family,
						rivals, etc.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="minor-heading-holder">
					<span class="h4">Functions</span>
				</div>
				<div class="desc">
					<p class="text-info">
						Right! Now to the nitty-gritty. So about 99% of your code will be encapsulized into functions, and if you have taken any
						kind of basic mathematics, you learn pretty early on what a function is. It looks something akin to this:
					</p>
					<div class="math-block">\[f ( x ) = x^2 + 3x - 5\]</div>
					<p class="text-info">
						Which in programming is extremely similar, it will look like this:
					</p>
					<div class="code-block">
						<span class="ccc-blue">function</span> <span class="ccc-func">f</span>(x) {
						<span class="indent-1"><span class="ccc-blue">return</span> (x*x + 3*x - 5);</span>
						}
					</div>
					<p class="text-info">
						But unlike mathematics, where you would traditionally name those functions f(x), g(x), and h(x) respectively, you are able
						to name the functions whatever you like, but it is recommended to name them something descriptive. Like instead of naming it
						just f(x), you can name it "parabola", "createParabola", or something of that sort. Because there will be tens to thousands
						of functions, and you won't remember what f(x) or d(x) or t(x) would do. And not only that but the parameters that you put in
						doesn't have to be x, or even just one thing. You can put as much as you like, or nothing at all! The names of the parameters
						should also be descriptive to better understand how it will be used. Not to mention that they don't necessarily need to be a
						number either it could be any kind of data type you would like to be. [ We will get to data types in a moment ] Here's an
						example different kinds of functions:
					</p>
					<div class="code-block">
						<span class="ccc-blue">function</span> <span class="ccc-func">displayPerson</span>(firstName, lastName, age) {
						<span class="indent-1">
							<span class="ccc-func">alert</span>(<span class="ccc-string">"Hello
								"</span>+lastName+<span class="ccc-string">",
								"</span>+firstName+<span class="ccc-string">"!
								You are "</span>+age+<span class="ccc-string">"
								years old!"</span>
							);
						</span>
						<span class="indent-1">
							<span class="ccc-comment">// This would display 'Hello Gonzalez-Becerra, Paul! You are 20 years old!' if you called</span>
						</span>
						<span class="indent-1">
							<span class="ccc-comment">// the function from somewhere like so 'displayPerson("Paul", "Gonzalez-Becerra", 20);'</span>
						</span>
						}
						<br /><br />
						<span class="ccc-comment">// It is also a good idea to comment on top of the function a super short summary of what it does</span><br />
						<span class="ccc-blue">function</span> <span class="ccc-func">displayOkSign</span>() {
						<span class="indent-1"><span class="ccc-func">alert</span>(<span class="ccc-string">"You are good to go!"</span>);</span>
						}
					</div>
					<p class="text-info">
						Now from this you should start to get the general gist of how things are being done. In fact the alert() you see within the
						functions is a function itself. Which, if you haven't already played with it, displays a dialog box top-centered of the web
						browser of whatever object is within the parenthesis. Heck you can even put a function as a parameter, and it will work just
						dandy. Although when you do that you must either provide the name of the function, or have a function right there as represented
						below.
					</p>
					<div class="code-block">
						<span class="ccc-comment">// This will take a function, which assumes it is an equation, and displays what y is when x = 5</span><br />
						<span class="ccc-blue">function</span> <span class="ccc-func">displayFunction</span>(func) {
						<span class="indent-1"><span class="ccc-func">alert</span>(func(5));</span>
						}
						<br /><br />
						<span class="ccc-comment">// This is a function for the parabola [ x^2 - 3x + 5 ]</span><br />
						<span class="ccc-blue">function</span> <span class="ccc-func">createParabola</span>(x) {
						<span class="indent-1"><span class="ccc-blue">return</span> (x*x - 3*x + 5);</span>
						}
						<br /><br />
						<span class="ccc-comment">// This will display '45'</span><br />
						<span class="ccc-func">displayFunction</span>(<span class="ccc-func">createParabola</span>);
						<br /><br />
						<span class="ccc-comment">// This will display '250'</span><br />
						<span class="ccc-func">displayFunction</span>(<span class="ccc-blue">function</span>(x) {
						<span class="indent-1"><span class="ccc-blue">return</span> (x*x*x + 5*x*x);</span>
						});
					</div>
					<p class="text-info">
						One last thing, for JavaScript it is runned the second it is detected. Which means that if you have code at the top
						of your page that messes with something at the bottom of your page, it won't be able to since it hasn't loaded in yet. In
						order to counteract this, there are two things you can do:
						<ol>
							<li>
								Put the code at the bottom of your page, so it will be the last thing you load. Which is a good idea, but that will usually
								get lost in your webpage code, which might be a pain to most, including me.
							</li>
							<li>
								Put your code at the top of your page, but load an event to call on your code when everything is up and ready, which will look
								like such:
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<div class="code-block">
						window.<span class="ccc-func">addEventListener</span>(<span class="ccc-blue">function</span>(args) {
						<span class="indent-1"><span class="ccc-comment">// Your code starts here</span></span>
						});

				<div class="minor-heading-holder">
					<span class="h4">Brief look at data types and automatic variables</span>
				</div>
				<div class="desc">
					<p class="text-info">
						I say a brief look at it because JavaScript supports data types but uses the automatic variable for everything. I mean EVERYTHING,
						it is pretty ridiculous and mind-boggling if you are not used to it. Essentially a data type tells the computer what the variable
						can do, what functions it has, what properties and variables it has inside it, the whole shebang! Which is great so you know exactly
						what you are getting and how to mess with thing accordingly. And automatic variables basically throw all that out the window! What
						automatic variables do is basically adjust to whatever you tell it to be. So if you want your variable, lets call it
						<span class="ccc-blue">x</span>, to represent a number, you assign it a number, like 4. Ok cool your variable is now 4, but what if you
						want to have it as a sentence for the age of your nephew. then just set that sucker to <span class="ccc-string">"4 years old"</span> and
						it will adjust accordingly. Want a function on it or a variable within it? You can do that, but it is alittle bit weirder, because that
						goes into creating classes/objects. Example:
					</p>
					<div class="code-block">
						<span class="ccc-comment">// Variables</span><br />
						<span class="ccc-blue">var</span> x = 4; <span class="ccc-comment">// This is creating a variable and setting it to 4</span><br />
						<br />
						<span class="ccc-comment">// This is setting the variable to be 4 years old</span><br />
						<span class="ccc-comment">// Note that x +=  " years old"; means the same thing as x = x+" years old";</span><br />
						x += <span class="ccc-string">" years old"</span>;<br/>
						<span class="ccc-comment">// Displays '4 years old'</span><br/>
						<span class="ccc-func">alert</span>(x);<br />
