					<p>In the beginning there was once only three nations: The Humans of Vangard, ruled by
					King Fredrick the Brave. The Dwarfs of Azyria, ruled by Azur-Nasipal the Ruthless.
					And the Elfs of Catlan, ruled by King Pelagius the Cunning. Warring against one another,
					the fiendish Orcs found their time to strike and caused an uproar around the middle of
					Catlan. This gave way for Azur-Nasipal to have the upper hand and attack Catlan. Fredrick,
					however, aided King Pelagius. For he believed that the Orcs were much too savage to be
					civilized.</p>

					<p>Alas King Fredrick lost his life trying to win a hopeless war. The orcs won and took
					over a third of Catlan, what is now called Iberia, and split Catlan in half. It wasn't until
					his great grandson, young Prince Fredrick IV, took the throne and stopped all this bloodshed.
					He established a nation where people from everywhere can live freely, trade freely, and find
					opportunities to make a better life. The King has become old now, and by that time he has
					successfully attained the peace he wanted.</p>
