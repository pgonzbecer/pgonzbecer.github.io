					<p>In the tales of old, there was once only three nations: The Humans of Vangard. The
					Dwarfs of Azyria. And the Elfs of Catlan. Now there stand five, due to the Orcish
					uprising, which split Catlan in half. The great King of Vangard helped Catlan against
					this uprising, cementing their allegiance to one another. Though the king fought hard,
					the war was lost and with it, his life. Generations have past and although Vangard still
					has some hatred against Iberia, the Orcish Nation, that will not stop them on achieving
					world peace.</p>

					<p class="fourth-wall-breaker">The following is stuff you should know about this small town:</p>
					
					<span class="h4">Michael, the Barkeep</span><br/><br/>
					<p class="details">Michael is just a simple barkeep. Though he never really expresses emotion and
					talks with such a monotone voice, he aids everyone with finding work. Such as clearing out a cave
					filled with goblins or something.</p>
					<br/>
					<span class="h4">Kevin and Keith, the Valice Brothers</span><br/><br/>
					<p class="details">Kevin is an arrogant Fighter who loves to compete against others. He passes his
					time by working at the Valice Inn with his father, working on odd jobs that the pub
					puts up every once in a while, or by getting violently drunk. Keith, the younger brother, is
					a Bard who plays for the drunks over at the pub. He is more of a diplomat than his
					brother, though he will always go on odd jobs with his bigger brother to make sure
					he is ok.</p>
					<br/>
					<span class="h4">The Clerics of Sarenrae, Lilliana and Jerald</span><br/><br/>
					<p class="details">These clerics are located at the church, they are healing
					clerics so they will heal whomever asks. Lilliana is the mother to Kevin
					and Keith, she has asked you before to take care of her children if you ever see
					them on one of your quests. Jerald on the other hand was once evil, he has then
					put that aside and redeemed himself as a healer. Although you still don't know
					who he used to work for or what exactly he did.</p>
