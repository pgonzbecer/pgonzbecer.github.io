				For the COS SURGE People:<br/>
				Here are a couple of guidelines to getting started
				with the SURGE project.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Sign up for GitHub</b>: There is a website where you can upload
						your code for a project and it will tie everything in together on
						the parts where you editted, no nasty overrides. Check it out at
						<a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>
					</li>
					<br/>
					<li>
						<b>Understand how to use GitHub</b>: Sounds simple, but it is quite
						tricky to understand at first. Don't know where to start? GitHub has
						a thing to help you, <a target="_blank" href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/">
						here</a>, although it is still a little vague. It basically wants you to
						download a seperate program that it works in tangent with,
						<a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. And don't worry everything is
						free! Here are some pointers to try and get the grasp of GitHub
						<ul>
							<li>Make a couple of projects and then delete them later</li>
							<li>Try to upload and manage a couple of files, doesn't have to be
							the best or make sense, just try uploading a .txt somehow</li>
							<li>Try to fork someone's work, and mess around with it. Doesn't
							destroy the original's work.</li>
							<li>Go to the <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/johnRedden/">team leader</a>'s
							GitHub and fork one of his works, and try to improve it somehow. So we
							can get the feel of cooperating, without much cooperating.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br/>
					<li>
						<b>Download Visual Studio Express</b>: Visual Studio Express is
						free, but the non-Express version is not. They are also on
						<a target="_blank" href="http://dreamspark.com/">DreamSpark</a>. Doesn't necessarily have
						to be visual studio, but the team leader prefers it. As long as you are
						able to host the website in a local host or something on a server, and
						not on a local file system, you should be good. Heck, GitHub provides a
						nice 'website' hosting for these kinds of things,
						<a target="_blank" href="http://pages.github.com/">here</a>. Why? I certainly don't
						understand why, but some of the stuff we might be making may not work on a
						local file system.
					</li>
					<br/>
					<li>
						<b>Understand Bootstrap</b>: Bootstrap is a staple nowadays for any kind
						of website designer. It's sleek, it's nice, and it's beautiful, it makes
						the 90's look of a website look like to 2010's average phone app, without
						any real effort. It is just a bunch of CSS and JavaScript that can be
						easily downloaded <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">here</a>, and
						documentation here for <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">CSS</a>
						and <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript">JavaScript</a>. Although
						we will most likely be using the CSS portion of it.
					</li>
					<br/>
					<li>
						<b>"Study Up" on the current works of the Team Leader</b>: There isn't much
						on the team leader's <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/johnRedden/">GitHub</a> but
						there is a repository called "
						<a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/johnRedden/SurgeWebSite/">SurgeWebSite</a>". Look
						at the code, try and understand what is being done, learn from it, eat with
						it, and sleep with it. The more you understand how the project is pieced
						together, the better. Although a large portion of that project using
						<a target="_blank" href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/">JSXGraph</a>, which as of right
						now, it is still undecided for the project.
