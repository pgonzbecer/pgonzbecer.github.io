						<p>
							&emsp;&emsp;I am from a small town about half an hour south of Fresno, CA called
							<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Visalia,+CA/">Visalia</a>. I learned how to program at a young age, and developed that
							skill throughout childhood and into adulthood. My desired job is to be an Inventor, unspecific of course, and as I developed the
							art of programming, I concentrated that desire into a Computer Programmer / Game Developer. I'm a gamer at heart, and it is what
							brought me to programming. I currently go to school at <a href="http://www.cos.edu/">College of the Sequoias</a>, getting a B.S.
							degree in Computer Science, aiming for M.S. and/or PhD. While at the same time trying to get a dual certificate in
							<a href="http://www.cos.edu/Admissions/ClassSearch/Documents/2014-2015%20General%20Catalog.pdf#page=245">Computer &amp; Information
							Systems</a> and <a href="http://www.cos.edu/Admissions/ClassSearch/Documents/2015-2016%20General%20Catalog.pdf#page=233">Computer
							Programming &amp; Information Systems</a>.

				<span class="h2">How to contact me</span><br/>
				
				<div class="text-info">
					<p>
						&emsp;&emsp;The best way to contact me is via e-mail [ pgonzbecer@gmail.com ]. I check
						it regularly, on average about 4 times a day. But since I have more than one
						way to technically contact me, I will provide them all by the following list:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>E-Mail</strong>: pgonzbecer@gmail.com</li>
						<li><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href="http://www.github.com/pgonzbecer/">pgonzbecer</a></li>
						<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong>: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgonzbecer/">Paul Gonzalez-Becerra</a></li>
						<li><strong>FreeLancer</strong>: <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/u/PGonzBecer.html">PGonzBecer</a></li>
						<li><strong>Facebook</strong>: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/people/Paul-Gonzalez-Becerra/100004267842956">Paul Gonzalez</a></li>
						<li><strong>Twitter</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/PGonzBecer">@PGonzBecer</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						&emsp;&emsp;Do note that the way I ordered these is from most frequently checked, with E-Mail and GitHub being (almost) everyday to Facebook
						and Twitter being (almost) once a month/year. And if you do contact me, please entail in the message, who you are and what your
						business is. Thank you.
					</p>

				<div class="text-info">
					<p>
						&emsp;&emsp;Because I am human, and I make plenty of mistakes. Most of them will pretty much be overlooked, if you have a bug or crash to
						report I will usually provide a spot for you to funnel those in. At the same time, if you have an idea to improve or add to whatever it is
						that I created you that same spot for bugs and crashes will be used for that too.
					</p>
					<p>
						&emsp;&emsp;With that being said, to report something on this site you can go to the
						<a href="https://www.github.com/pgonzbecer/pgonzbecer.github.io/issues">GitHub Repository</a> and post an issue there.
